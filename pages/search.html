This year’s obligation will be light; simply shadow the current co-directors. Observe what currently is done, how it is done, and when it is done. In the hope that you stay with us the following year (2019) then, with John and Jennifer’s support, assume responsibility for some of the tasks as you become more comfortable. If, however, you do not want a mentoring period but are ready to become more actively engaged right now then reach out to John Jones and he will get you started (he promises).Two types of persons are sought.      A person comfortable communicating with guest exhibitors; who would reach out to current and new/fresh guest exhibitors to arrange and track their confirmation to participate and to acquire their guest approval forms.        A person comfortable with Microsoft Excel and Word; who would serve as registrar tracking participating students, printing certificates, and printing event night programs.  Ideally you are a parent/guardian with a student in the K-2 grades.  This is a once per year commitment that supports not only the students and their interest in science but engages parents and guardians and guest exhibitors lifting the evening above a mere show and tell to become a Brassfield community extravaganza! To become a part of this great service to others please contact John Jones or Jennifer Oldson this week.Kindest regards,John Jones - jt.jones@earthlink.net - (919) 605-7976 Jennifer Oldson - joldsondvm@gmail.com - oldsonzoo@gmail.com",

Our students deserve the best public schools and teachers! We want great families and teaches to stay in NC public schools. The difference between the 2007-2008 and the 2016-2017 legislative overview is hard to digest.        Our state legislature needs to fully fund the class size initiative to include money for extra teachers and specialists. Understand the class size chaos.  Remember that this is a legislative mandate, not a WCPSS mandate.       Our veteran principals and teachers are a vital part to our educational system!        What is the class size mandate?    Legislation sets next year's (2018-19) class sizes at an absolute maximum of:           Kindergarten1st Grade2nd Grade3rd Grade      18161717            What about budget cuts?    Public school teachers don’t have adequate funding for basic classroom needs.    The new salary schedules for veteran teachers / administrators are meaning and embarrassing.       Who is impacted?     Anyone with a child in a NC public school    The legislature didn't properly fund the mandate to cut class size in the lower grades so that much-needed physical education, arts, music, and language instruction wouldn’t be eliminated.      Space for smaller classes was not accounted for, so some classes may be split or forced to meet in makeshift locations.      Teacher salaries come from one pot / allocation / fund.  If we need more teachers in K-3 classroom, we will have to increase class sizes in all grades above that (4th – 12th) to pull teachers to the lower grades.

<h5><a href="/pages/class-size-chaos.html">What is the class size mandate?</a></h5>
<p>The maximum individual K-3 class sizes will drop from 24 students to:  K: 18, 1st: 16, and 2nd: 17 students.  For a year round school like ours, imagine pulling 2 students from the K class as they graduate to 1st and then adding one back when they rise to 2nd.  Children need some stability and consistency.  Pulling one or two kids from a track and switching them year to year and possibly from track to track will have broad reaching implications for families with older siblings.</p>

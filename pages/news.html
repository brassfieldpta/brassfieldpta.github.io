This year’s obligation will be light; simply shadow the current co-directors. Observe what currently is done, how it is done, and when it is done. In the hope that you stay with us the following year (2019) then, with John and Jennifer’s support, assume responsibility for some of the tasks as you become more comfortable. If, however, you do not want a mentoring period but are ready to become more actively engaged right now then reach out to John Jones and he will get you started (he promises).</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
It's hard to believe the holidays are upon us. That means it's almost time to get out the flour and sugar and send some good cheer to all of the teachers and staff at Brassfield who do so much for our children every day. Each year, the PTA Staff Appreciation & Hospitality Committee, together with the support of our wonderful parent volunteers, assembles a box of homemade cookies for each teacher and staff member at the school. We hear countless compliments and words of thanks for doing this and have been told repeatedly it's one of the favorite days of the school year. </p>
<p class="indent" style="color: red">
UPDATE! We are currently short 125 dozen cookies.  The staff loves the cookie boxes provided by Brassfield families at the holidays.  No time to bake?  Store bought are perfect for all, but especially for our staff with GF and Dairy Free allergies.</p>

<h5><a href="/pages/class-size-chaos.html">What is the class size mandate?</a></h5>
<p>The maximum individual K-3 class sizes will drop from 24 students to:  K: 18, 1st: 16, and 2nd: 17 students.  For a year round school like ours, imagine pulling 2 students from the K class as they graduate to 1st and then adding one back when they rise to 2nd.  Children need some stability and consistency.  Pulling one or two kids from a track and switching them year to year and possibly from track to track will have broad reaching implications for families with older siblings.</p>

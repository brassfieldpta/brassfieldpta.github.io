<h5><a href="/pages/class-size-chaos.html">What is the class size mandate?</a></h5>
<p>The maximum individual K-3 class sizes will drop from 24 students to:  K: 18, 1st: 16, and 2nd: 17 students.  For a year round school like ours, imagine pulling 2 students from the K class as they graduate to 1st and then adding one back when they rise to 2nd.  Children need some stability and consistency.  Pulling one or two kids from a track and switching them year to year and possibly from track to track will have broad reaching implications for families with older siblings.</p>

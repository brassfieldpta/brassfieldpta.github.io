              <h4>A NEW CLUB AT BRASSFIELD-MORNING MOVEMENT!</h4> 
              <p>A new club opportunity is coming in January 2018! The Brassfield Morning Movement Club will begin on <strong>Friday, January 5, 2018 for (K-2)</strong> &amp; <strong>Friday, January 12, 2018 for (3rd-5th.)</strong> The club will meet from 8:00-8:45 AM on Friday mornings in the Multi-Purpose Room (Gym.) Each age group will meet every other week. The missions of the movement club are to get kids moving and to make them aware of how their breath can help them calm down and focus.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ljsVXBXHPhOyiy5UzYjK7zgn6C1o1W4IT0RQf35iuHU/edit?usp=sharing">Sign up your child for the club.</a> <em>Updated 12/15/2017</em></p>

<h5 id="morning-movement-club-faqs">Morning Movement Club FAQs</h5>

<p><strong>How can I register my child for the club?</strong> On-line. Look for the web link for the permission/registration on the Brassfield Web Site on Nov. 29th &amp; in the Brassfield Bulletin E-Newsletter during that same week.</p>

<p><strong>What will my child need to bring?</strong> Each child will need a yoga mat! Your child may bring his or her own mat each week, or he/she may use one that has been donated to the Brassfield PTA for the club.</p>

<p><strong>Will you need parent volunteers?</strong> Yes! Look for a web link to the Sign Up Genius for Parent Volunteers within the on-line registration form and in upcoming Brassfield Bulletin E-Newsletters. (Note: All volunteers must have Volunteer Clearance with WCPSS)</p>

<p><strong>Who will be leading the club?</strong>  Parent Volunteers: Amy Buchan (Tr 2) &amp; Jennifer Johnson (Tr 1)</p>

<p><strong>If I have a yoga mat / yoga mats that I’d like to donate to Brassfield PTA to be used by K-5 students, then where should I bring them?</strong> Beginning Nov. 27th, there will be a large box in the lobby labeled: “Yoga Mat donations for Brassfield Morning Movement Club.”</p>

<h5><a href="/pages/class-size-chaos.html">What is the class size mandate?</a></h5>
<p>The maximum individual K-3 class sizes will drop from 24 students to:  K: 18, 1st: 16, and 2nd: 17 students.  For a year round school like ours, imagine pulling 2 students from the K class as they graduate to 1st and then adding one back when they rise to 2nd.  Children need some stability and consistency.  Pulling one or two kids from a track and switching them year to year and possibly from track to track will have broad reaching implications for families with older siblings.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your engagement on this issue!  I look forward to working with all of you as we advocate for our schools, teachers and students regarding this class size mandate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the attached flier that you are welcome to use at your schools to educate parents and families about this issue and its effects on WCPSS schools.  This flier has been reviewed by staff with the school district to make sure my bullet points are correct.  Please distribute widely and get your families engaged and informed on this &quot;class size chaos.&quot;  The more people we have talking about it and contacting state legislators, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If you haven't joined our Advocacy hub on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wakepta.memberhub.com/hub/WakePT96219 &quot; onclick=&quot;trackOutboundLink('https://wakepta.memberhub.com/hub/WakePT96219 ')&quot;&gt;MemberHub&lt;/a&gt;, I encourage you to do so to connect with more schools and PTA leaders.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to meeting many of you at our upcoming event which is tentatively planned for October 16.  In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or our Council with any questions you may have.  Thank you again for your service to PTA and your efforts to speak up for every child! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;morning-movement-club-faqs&quot;&gt;Morning Movement Club FAQs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I register my child for the club?&lt;/strong&gt; On-line. Look for the web link for the permission/registration on the Brassfield Web Site on Nov. 29th &amp;amp; in the Brassfield Bulletin E-Newsletter during that same week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will my child need to bring?&lt;/strong&gt; Each child will need a yoga mat! Your child may bring his or her own mat each week, or he/she may use one that has been donated to the Brassfield PTA for the club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you need parent volunteers?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Look for a web link to the Sign Up Genius for Parent Volunteers within the on-line registration form and in upcoming Brassfield Bulletin E-Newsletters. (Note: All volunteers must have Volunteer Clearance with WCPSS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will be leading the club?&lt;/strong&gt;  Parent Volunteers: Amy Buchan (Tr 2) &amp;amp; Jennifer Johnson (Tr 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I have a yoga mat / yoga mats that I’d like to donate to Brassfield PTA to be used by K-5 students, then where should I bring them?&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning Nov. 27th, there will be a large box in the lobby labeled: “Yoga Mat donations for Brassfield Morning Movement Club.”&lt;/p&gt;

This year’s obligation will be light; simply shadow the current co-directors. Observe what currently is done, how it is done, and when it is done. In the hope that you stay with us the following year (2019) then, with John and Jennifer’s support, assume responsibility for some of the tasks as you become more comfortable. If, however, you do not want a mentoring period but are ready to become more actively engaged right now then reach out to John Jones and he will get you started (he promises).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two types of persons are sought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person comfortable communicating with guest exhibitors; who would reach out to current and new/fresh guest exhibitors to arrange and track their confirmation to participate and to acquire their guest approval forms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A person comfortable with Microsoft Excel and Word; who would serve as registrar tracking participating students, printing certificates, and printing event night programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you are a parent/guardian with a student in the K-2 grades.  This is a once per year commitment that supports not only the students and their interest in science but engages parents and guardians and guest exhibitors lifting the evening above a mere show and tell to become a Brassfield community extravaganza! To become a part of this great service to others please contact John Jones or Jennifer Oldson this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kindest regards,&lt;/p&gt;

It's hard to believe the holidays are upon us. That means it's almost time to get out the flour and sugar and send some good cheer to all of the teachers and staff at Brassfield who do so much for our children every day. Each year, the PTA Staff Appreciation &amp; Hospitality Committee, together with the support of our wonderful parent volunteers, assembles a box of homemade cookies for each teacher and staff member at the school. We hear countless compliments and words of thanks for doing this and have been told repeatedly it's one of the favorite days of the school year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot; style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;
UPDATE! We are currently short 125 dozen cookies.  The staff loves the cookie boxes provided by Brassfield families at the holidays.  No time to bake?  Store bought are perfect for all, but especially for our staff with GF and Dairy Free allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
